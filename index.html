#### Event Submission Guidelines

Let us know what's happening in Canberra!
  
WhatsOnCanberra.com.au makes it easy for people to find local events put on by locals. It emphasises free and cheap events that are family accessible. We generally do not post events of international artists coming into town, there are lots of websites that list those. We add value to the community by filtering out local from non-local things happening.
  
- [Submit a local event via Facebook](http://facebook.com/whatsOnCanberra/)
